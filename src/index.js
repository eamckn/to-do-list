/* Project brainstorm

- I want each to-do item to have a title, description, duedate, and priority listing.
- I want the creation of each to-do to be a factory that returns an object with those values.
- I also want a separate function to handle creating each item.
- I want to first start with making sure that my objects are being created appropriately
- I'm going to first create the factory that will create and return to-dos, as well as the
factory that will call the create to-do function
